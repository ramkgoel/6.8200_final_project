1. Write midterm report

First working on the states version (vision later): 

Environment Setup
 - Understand the env already copied
 - Clearly understand the states and action spaces in the code
 - 

Create a Dataset class
 - Create a visualization of our dataset somehow? (We will be using the "pusht_cchi_v7_replay.zarr.zip")

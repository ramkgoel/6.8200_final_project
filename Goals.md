1. Write midterm report

First working on the states version (vision later): 

Environment Setup
 - Understand the env already copied
 - Clearly understand the states and action spaces in the code
 - 

Create a Dataset class
 - Create a visualization of our dataset somehow? (We will be using the "pusht_cchi_v7_replay.zarr.zip")

Write the Noise Prediction network (in "noise_prediction_net.py")

Find the conditional action distribution once we have this (negate to get score function and do the Langevin stuff) -- "action_distrib.py"

Then train.py
